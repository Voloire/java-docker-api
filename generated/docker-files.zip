Here's a complete set of files for containerizing the Spring Boot service, following best practices:

Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /workspace/app

COPY mvnw .
COPY .mvn .mvn
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src src

RUN ./mvnw install -DskipTests
RUN mkdir -p target/dependency && (cd target/dependency; jar -xf ../*.jar)

# Run stage
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine
VOLUME /tmp
ARG DEPENDENCY=/workspace/app/target/dependency
COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/lib /app/lib
COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/META-INF /app/META-INF
COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/classes /app
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-cp","app:app/lib/*","com.example.helloapi.HelloApiApplication"]

# Security: Run as non-root user
RUN addgroup -S spring && adduser -S spring -G spring
USER spring:spring
```

docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  hello-api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/actuator/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```

.dockerignore:
```
**/.classpath
**/.dockerignore
**/.env
**/.git
**/.gitignore
**/.project

# Hello API - Spring Boot Containerized Application

This project is a simple Spring Boot REST API that exposes a `/hello` endpoint. It's containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose (optional, for easy local deployment)

## Building the Application

To build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t hello-api .
```

## Running the Application

### Using Docker

To run the application using Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 hello-api
```

### Using Docker Compose

To run the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Accessing the API

Once the application is running, you can access the API at:

```
http://localhost:8080/hello
```

## Health Check

The application includes a health check endpoint at:

```
http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

## Building and Running Without Docker

If you want to build and run the application without Docker:

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean package
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/hello-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

## Security Considerations

- The application runs as a non-root user inside the container.
- HTTPS is not configured in this basic setup. For production, consider adding SSL/TLS.
- The Docker image uses a minimal JRE base to reduce attack surface.

## Customization

- Environment variables can be adjusted in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- For production deployments, consider using environment-specific configuration files.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the Docker logs:

```bash
docker logs <container_id>
```

Replace `<container_id>` with the actual container ID or name.
```

These files provide a lean, secure, and optimized setup for containerizing the Spring Boot application. The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build to minimize the final image size. The docker-compose.yml file includes a health check and allows for easy local deployment. The .dockerignore file prevents unnecessary files from being included in the Docker context. The README.md provides clear instructions for building, running, and customizing the containerized application.
